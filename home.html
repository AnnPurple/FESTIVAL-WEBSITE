                    <p><strong>Lucban, Quezon (May 15)</strong> The term ‘pahiyas’ comes from the word ‘payas’. This means to decorate or embellish.The Pahiyas Festival is a celebration of gratitude following a plentiful harvest. <strong>‘Pahiyas’</strong> literally means <strong>“precious offering”</strong> and the practice dates back to the 16th century. It is observed in remembrance of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. The occasion has typically been understated. However, a group of artists made the decision to organize an exhibition in 1963 that included handicrafts, folk dances, works of art, and photographs from all over the Philippines. That is how the current Pahiyas Festival came to be.</p>

                <h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
                <p>When Franciscan missionaries arrived in Quezon in <strong>1583</strong> and brought Catholicism with them, the people of Lucban performed a ritual gift-giving ceremony known as the Pahiyas Festival. Juan de Placencia, the town's first vicar, kept up the custom of giving the crop to the Spanish friars. He did it as an expression of gratitude for a bountiful harvest. The rite was continued by the subsequent parish priest, Diego de Oropesa, until it was a common occurrence in Lucban.</p>
                
                <h5><strong>Costume</strong></h5>
                <p>You can witness a stunning procession of costumes made of natural materials and local objects during the Pahiyas Festival. These include the rice wafers known as kiping, banig, and abaka. <strong>The lakan and lakambini</strong> <em>(mister and miss)</em> of the Philippines also grinned at everyone. The models generously advertise Lucban, native goods from Quezon. Additionally, the attire appeals to both tourists and residents with a strong sense of admiration for creativity and ingenuity. This demonstrates that what is important is not what one wears, such as extravagant clothing or materials. It is more the beauty within, especially the beauty of the heart.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bacolod City (October) </strong>A festival that is celebrated from the city of smiles – Bacolod City. Mass (crowd) kara (face) Festival is filled with people wearing colourful smiling masks designed with feathers, flowers, and native beads. The festival allows tourists to enjoy 20 days of beer drinking, street dancing, and merrymaking. Every street is filled with locals wearing their smiling masks and festive costumes while dancing around and spreading the happy atmosphere throughout the city. During the festival, locals are encouraged to forget the economic struggle brought about by the dead season of the sugar harvest. They also see the festival as their way of escapism and obscurantism. The sugar harvest is important to the people of Bacolod since Negros Occidental, where Bacolod is found, is known as the Sugar Bowl of the Philippines.</p>

                <h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
                <p>The MassKara Festival started in <strong>1980</strong> during the dictatorship of the late President Ferdinand Marcos. The prices of sugar, the province’s main agricultural crop and livelihood source, were at a record low following the introduction of sugar alternatives into the market. Consequently, two artists came up with the idea of promoting mask making as an alternative source of income for the locals. In the same year, a tragic ferry incident occurred — the MV Don Juan sank, resulting in the deaths of many people from the province. The MassKara Festival was then created to bring back smiles and uplift the locals’ spirits during those difficult times.</p>
                
                <h5><strong>Costume</strong></h5>
                <p>The highlight of the MassKara Festival is a dance competition, where participants don colorful costumes and vibrant, smiling masks and dance to Latin music. Besides this, there is Bacolod’s biggest street party, Electric MassKara. As the most awaited festival event, this night parade features LED-lit dancers, bands, and floats. Other activities include the MassKara Festival Queen beauty pageant, food festivals, and float parade. The festival, flooded by locals and tourists, is renowned for its colorful decorations and masks.</p>

                    <p><strong>San Fernando (the weekend before Christmas Eve) </strong>San Fernando organises the biggest festival in the country. It features a competition of giant lantern making, which is why it has been called the “Christmas Capital of the Philippines”. This is also to celebrate the Christmas season, where participants produce up to fifteen-foot diameter lanterns. It is a rule that each lantern should be made out of locally available materials. These lanterns are showcased in a parade in each barrio before the midnight mass on Christmas Eve. The word parol derives from the Spanish farol, meaning lantern or light. Filipinos place much significance on the symbolism of light, the star regarded as a fount of light and a sign of hope in the predominantly Christian country in Asia. Such a creation however, did not come without the untiring efforts of the Fernandinos, and more so, their ingenuity and innovation. And it is because of the Parul Sampernandu that San Fernando has earned for itself the title of <strong>“Christmas Capital of the Philippines.”</strong></p>

                <h5><strong>History</strong></h5>
                <p>The San Fernando lantern industry progressed from the Giant Lantern Festival of San Fernando. The festival, which is held every December, finds its root in Bacolor where a much simpler activity was held. “Ligligan Parul” (Lantern Competition) was said to have started in San Fernando in the year 1904. But some say that the “Ligligan Parul” did not happen immediately after the transfer and in fact began in 1908. This forerunner of the present day Giant Lantern Festival was in a religious activity which we know today as “lubenas”, a nine-day novena before Christmas, which coincided with the “simbang gabi” from December 16 to 24. This tradition gradually evolved as the lanterns became bigger and the designs more intricate. Later, one big lantern was made for each barrio, which was created through a cooperative effort.</p>
                
                <h5><strong>Costume</strong></h5>
                <p>The parol of star lantern is perhaps the paramount Filipino Christmas symbol – <strong>colorful, crafted with love and aglow with the spirit of the season</strong>. The Christmas lantern or Parul Sampernandu in Kapampangan can never be distanced from the town which created it, the City of San Fernando. It is what San Fernando is known for. And it is what has made the city famous all over the country and even around the world.</p>
